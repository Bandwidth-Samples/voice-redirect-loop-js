# Description
This sample app indefinitely redirects an inbound call to itself until an interruption is sent to end the call.  

In the Bandwidth Dashboard, set the Application's `Call initiated callback URL` to `<BASE_CALLBACK_URL>/callbacks/inboundCall`. This can also be done via the Dashboard API by setting `CallInitiatedCallbackUrl`. Once configured, inbound calls to your `BW_NUMBER` will be redirected every 30 seconds and ring indefinitely. The `callId` of the inbound call is saved to an `active_calls` array, which can be accessed via a GET request to the `/calls` endpoint provided by the app.

To stop a call, make a DELETE request to the `/calls/{callId}` endpoint, replacing `{callId}` with that of the call you wish to end. This endpoint will redirect the call to the `/callbacks/callEnded` endpoint, which breaks the redirect loop and speaks a sentence to let you know the call has been ended before hanging up.

# Pre-Requisites

In order to use the Bandwidth API users need to set up the appropriate application at the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/) and create API tokens.

To create an application log into the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/) and navigate to the `Applications` tab.  Fill out the **New Application** form selecting the service (Messaging or Voice) that the application will be used for.  All Bandwidth services require publicly accessible Callback URLs, for more information on how to set one up see [Callback URLs](#callback-urls).

For more information about API credentials see our [Account Credentials](https://dev.bandwidth.com/docs/account/credentials) page.

# Running the Application

To install the required packages for this app, run the command:

```sh
npm i
```

Use the following command to run the application:

```sh
npm start
```

# Environmental Variables
The sample app uses the below environmental variables.
```sh
BW_ACCOUNT_ID                 # Your Bandwidth Account Id
BW_USERNAME                   # Your Bandwidth API username
BW_PASSWORD                   # Your Bandwidth API password
BW_VOICE_APPLICATION_ID       # Your Voice Application Id created in the dashboard
LOCAL_PORT                    # The port number you wish to run the sample on
BASE_CALLBACK_URL             # The public base url
```

# Callback URLs

For a detailed introduction, check out our [Bandwidth Voice Callbacks](https://dev.bandwidth.com/docs/voice/quickStart#configuring-callback-urls) page.

Below are the callback paths:
* `/callbacks/inboundCall`
* `/callbacks/callEnded`

## Ngrok

A simple way to set up a local callback URL for testing is to use the free tool [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).  
After you have downloaded and installed `ngrok` run the following command to open a public tunnel to your port (`$LOCAL_PORT`)

```cmd
ngrok http $LOCAL_PORT
```

You can view your public URL at `http://127.0.0.1:4040` after ngrok is running.  You can also view the status of the tunnel and requests/responses here. Once your public ngrok url has been created, you can use it as the `BASE_CALLBACK_URL` environmental variable and set it in the voice application created in the [Pre-Requisites](#pre-requisites) section.
